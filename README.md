# Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition:

## Overview

The goal of this competition is to predict the final sale price of residential homes using various features describing the property.

This notebook builds a regression pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model ensembling.

The final prediction is generated using an ensemble of:

- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- LightGBM

These models were selected to combine the strengths of regularized linear models and gradient boosting trees.

## Approach

### Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were applied:

- Missing value imputation based on feature semantics.
  Especially, in `LotFrontage`, imputation with speculated by a Random Forest model using `LotArea` and `LotConfig` as explanatory variables.
- Converting rankings in categorical columns into meaningful scales to enable a model to understand the relative order of quality
- Creating eight new variables
  1. `TotalSF`: Total floor area of the entire house (`GrLivArea` + `TotalBamtSF`)
  2. `TotalPorchSF`: Total area of outdoor recreational spaces
  3. `Has2ndFlr`: Whether the house has a 2nd floor or not
  4. `TotalSF_x_Qual`: Total area multiplied by overall quality
  5. `BsmtSF_x_Qual`: Total basement area multiplied by its quality
  6. `HouseAge`: Subtract the year of constraction from the year of sale
  7. `YearSinceRemod`: Subtract the year of reconstruction from the year of sale
  8. `TotalBath`: Total number of bath
- Log transformation of `SalePrice` and some explanatory variables with an absolute value of skewness of over 0.75
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables

### Models

Three models were trained and combined using weighted averaging.

**Lasso Regression**

- Uses L1 regularization
- Performs implicit feature selection
- Works well with high-dimensional one-hot encoded data

**Ridge Regression**

- Uses L2 regularization
- Handles multicollinearity between features
- Provides stable linear predictions

**LightGBM**

- Gradient boosting tree model
- Captures nonlinear relationships and feature interactions
- Complements linear models in the ensemble

#### Ensemble

The final prediction is generated using a weighted average of the three models.

Combining linear models and gradient boosting improves robustness and generalization.

## Discussion

This solution achieved a public leaderboard score of **0.12242**, indicating that the overall pipeline was effective, particularly the combination of feature engineering and model ensembling.

One important takeaway from this project is that linear models remained very competitive for this dataset. Lasso and Ridge performed well because many relationships in the data became approximately linear after preprocessing, while LightGBM complemented them by capturing nonlinear patterns and feature interactions.

Handling missing values based on feature semantics was also critical. Distinguishing between true missing values and features that were simply absent helped preserve useful information and improved model performance.

Outlier handling was carefully evaluated during experimentation. Removing extreme outliers based on `GrLivArea` initially seemed reasonable from a visual inspection. However, the leaderboard results showed that keeping these data led to better performance. This suggests that the model was able to learn from these samples, and removing them resulted in a loss of useful information.

There is still room for improvement. Future work includes evaluating the ensemble using out-of-fold predictions, optimizing ensemble weights more systematically, and validating feature engineering steps more rigorously using cross-validation rather than relying solely on leaderboard feedback.
